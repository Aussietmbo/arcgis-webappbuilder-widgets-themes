## How to add widgets into Web AppBuilder or a built app
To add widgets into the builder, follow these steps:

1. Open manifest.json file in widget folder. It describes widget properties as shown in the following table.
2. Modify the properties accordingly.
3. Save the file.
4. Copy the widget folder and paste it in the widgets repository. By default, the widgets repository is located under \client\stemapp\widgets folder. In this way, your widget is available to the builder. If you prefer to deploy the widget to a specific app only, you can copy the widget folder and paste it in the stemapp folder within the downloaded app, then configure it in the app config file.
